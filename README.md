# monster-game-using-vue
Tried my hand on front-end web development using vue js
The game is simple you have to attack the monster and the monster attacks you as well
on every turn the damage done is a random number, for every turn ther  is a possibility that the monster can deal a higher damage than you do to him so make sure to heal yourself in between but be ware the monster can deal you damage even while you heal. you can use super-attack to deal higher damage
